# Web Visualization Dashboard

## Background

We used HTML and CSS to create our dashboard showing off the data analysis that we've done.

## Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this project, we created a visualization dashboard website. 

In building this dashboard, we create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
